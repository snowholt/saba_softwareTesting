### Testing Methodology
The project implements a comprehensive three-tier testing approach:

#### 1. Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Validate individual functions in isolation
- **Coverage**: All calculator and validator functions
- **Test Cases**: 8 focused test cases
- **Focus**: Function-level correctness and edge cases

#### 2. Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify component interactions
- **Coverage**: Calculator-validator integration, main application flow
- **Test Cases**: 6 interaction test cases
- **Focus**: Component communication and data flow

#### 3. System Testing
- **Purpose**: Validate end-to-end user workflows
- **Coverage**: Complete user scenarios, error handling, performance
- **Test Cases**: 8 workflow test cases
- **Focus**: User experience and system reliability

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Test Reports**: Detailed test execution reports in multiple formats
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representation of system components
- **Workflow Diagrams**: Testing and application flow illustrations

### Future Enhancements
- Add more financial calculation functions
